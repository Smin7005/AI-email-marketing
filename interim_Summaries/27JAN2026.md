# 1 Cannot run inngest locally. Fail to run 'npx inngest@latest dev'
● I see the issue. There are two problems here:

  Problem 1: CLI Package Changed

  The npx inngest@latest dev command no longer works because the CLI was moved to a separate package. Use this instead:

  npx inngest-cli@latest dev

  Problem 2: Production Keys in Local Development

  You've set production INNGEST_EVENT_KEY and INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY from Inngest Cloud. For local development with the Dev Server, you typically   
  don't need these keys at all - the Dev Server handles everything locally.

  Recommended Setup for Local Testing

  Option A: Use local Dev Server (no cloud keys needed)

  1. Comment out or remove the Inngest keys for local dev:
  # INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=V-Me8nyLJ-...
  # INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=signkey-prod-...

  2. Run the Dev Server:
  npx inngest-cli@latest dev

  3. Start your Next.js app:
  npm run dev

  The Dev Server will discover your functions at http://localhost:3000/api/inngest automatically.

  Option B: If you want to use Inngest Cloud locally

  Set INNGEST_DEV=1 in your .env.local to force dev mode while keeping the cloud keys for later deployment.

  Would you like me to help you set up the local development configuration?

# 2 Delete the black background after click on save to collection.
● Found the issue. On line 112, the modal has bg-black bg-opacity-50 which creates the dark overlay. I'll remove those classes while keeping the modal centered.

● Done. I removed the bg-black bg-opacity-50 classes that were creating the dark overlay background. I also added a subtle border to the modal for better visual definition without the backdrop. Refresh the page and click "Save to Collection" - the dark overlay should no longer appear.
