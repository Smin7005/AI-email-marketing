# 1. comparison of 3 links from Vercel CLI
  1. Inspect (🔵)
  - Vercel Dashboard link for this specific deployment
  - View build logs, environment variables, deployment details
  - Only accessible to team members

  2. Production (✅)
  - The unique, immutable URL for this specific deployment
  - Never changes - you can always access this exact version
  - Useful for sharing a specific build or rollback reference

  3. Aliased (🔗)
  - Your main production URL that users visit
  - Always points to the latest production deployment
  - This is the "pretty" URL you share publicly
  - If you add a custom domain, it would also appear here

  In short:
  - Share the Aliased URL with users
  - Use Inspect to debug/monitor
  - Use Production URL to reference a specific version

# 2. For Inngest to work on Vercel in production, you need:
  1. INNGEST_EVENT_KEY - to send events to Inngest  
  2. INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY - for Inngest to verify webhook requests to your app  
  The user's .env.local has placeholder values for these (ZC-... and signkey-...) which are not real keys.                                         
  The user needs to:
  1. Go to https://app.inngest.com/ and create an account/project
  2. Get the real INNGEST_EVENT_KEY and INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY from the Inngest dashboard
  3. Add these to Vercel environment variables

  Let me explain this to the user.


  Found the issue. The endpoint uses Inngest for background job processing (email generation). You're missing two required environment variables:

  - INNGEST_EVENT_KEY - needed to send events to Inngest
  - INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY - needed for Inngest to call back to your app

  Your .env.local has placeholder values (ZC-... and signkey-...), not real keys.

  To fix this:

  1. Go to https://app.inngest.com/ and sign in (or create an account)
  2. Create/select your project
  3. Go to Settings or Manage → Keys
  4. Copy the Event Key and Signing Key

  Then add them to Vercel:

  printf "YOUR_REAL_EVENT_KEY" | npx vercel env add INNGEST_EVENT_KEY production
  printf "YOUR_REAL_SIGNING_KEY" | npx vercel env add INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY production

  After adding them, redeploy:
  npx vercel --prod

  Do you have access to Inngest, or do you need help getting the keys?

# 3. UI Summary of Changes Made                                                            
  Task: Improve the Recipients section in the Create Campaign page with capsule-based UI.
  What I implemented:      
  1. Created new Dialog component at src/components/ui/dialog.tsx using Radix UI for the modal popup.
  2. Updated Create Campaign page (src/app/(dashboard)/campaigns/create/page.tsx):

    - Capsule elements for collections: Each collection is shown as a pill-shaped capsule that can be clicked to select/deselect.
    - Red X button: Selected capsules show a red cross mark at the top-right corner to remove them.
    - Add button: A dashed "+" Add button to add individual recipients.
    - Modal popup: When clicking Add, a dialog appears with:
      - Email Address input field
      - Recipient Name input field
      - Cancel and Add buttons
    - Grid summary: Below the capsules, selected items are displayed in a responsive grid (collections show folder icon + count, individual recipients show avatar + email).
    - Multi-select support: Users can now select multiple collections AND add individual recipients simultaneously.

  Files modified:
  - src/components/ui/dialog.tsx (new)
  - src/app/(dashboard)/campaigns/create/page.tsx (updated)

# 4. Here's how to get your Inngest keys:
  
  Step 1: Go to Inngest Dashboard 
  - Visit https://app.inngest.com/
  - Sign in or create an account 
  
  Step 2: Create/Select an App
  - If you don't have an app, create one
  - Select your app from the dashboard

  Step 3: Get the Event Key
  - Go to Manage → Keys (or Settings → Keys)
  - Find Event Key (starts with something like ZC-... or similar)
  - Copy this as your INNGEST_EVENT_KEY

  Step 4: Get the Signing Key
  - On the same Keys page
  - Find Signing Key (starts with signkey-...)
  - Copy this as your INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY

  Step 5: Register your app URL
  - Go to Apps or Manage → Syncs
  - Add your production app URL: https://ai-email-marketing.vercel.app/api/inngest
  - Inngest will sync with your endpoint to discover your functions

  Step 6: Add to Vercel
  printf "YOUR_EVENT_KEY_HERE" | npx vercel env add INNGEST_EVENT_KEY production
  printf "YOUR_SIGNING_KEY_HERE" | npx vercel env add INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY production

  Step 7: Redeploy
  npx vercel --prod

  Would you like me to help you add the keys once you have them?

# 5. Deployment successful with Inngest keys.                                                                                
                                                                                                                          
  Your app is live at: https://ai-email-marketing.vercel.app   
  Next step: 
  You also need to sync your app with Inngest so it knows where to send events. In the Inngest dashboard:
  1. Go to Manage → Apps 
  2. Click Sync new app or Add app                                                                                        
  3. Enter your app URL: https://ai-email-marketing.vercel.app/api/inngest
  4. Click sync

  This tells Inngest where your functions are hosted so it can invoke them when events are triggered.

  After syncing, try the email generation feature again on your production site.
