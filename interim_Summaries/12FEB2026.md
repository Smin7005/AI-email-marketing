# 1. Now there is a bug at email sending function, when users' customers received this email, the contact name on Google email is always 'Your Company'. We need to replace it with 'Campaign Name' input from 'Campaign Details' card component on 'Campaign page'.

  All three locations have been fixed. Here's a summary of the changes:

  Root cause: When creating a campaign, the sender_name field was hardcoded to 'Your Company' instead of using the campaign name entered by the user. This value flows through to the email From header ("Your Company <email>") which Gmail displays as the contact name.
                                                                                                                                                                   
  Changes made:

  1. src/lib/services/campaign-supabase.ts:86 — Changed sender_name: 'Your Company' to sender_name: name
  2. src/lib/services/campaign.ts:45 — Changed senderName: 'Your Company' to senderName: name (manual email path)
  3. src/lib/services/campaign.ts:92 — Changed senderName: 'Your Company' to senderName: name (normal path with business IDs)

  Now when an email is sent, the From header will be "Campaign Name <sender@email.com>" instead of "Your Company <sender@email.com>", and recipients will see the campaign name as the contact name in Gmail.

  Note: This fix applies to newly created campaigns. Existing campaigns in the database will still have sender_name: 'Your Company' — you can update those directly in Supabase if needed.
